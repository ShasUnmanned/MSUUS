QR Code Reader:

I wish I could impress all of y'all and say that I figured this out on my own, but no,

I literally just followed someone's instructions.

I'm not sure what system we're running this on, I assume its some distro of linux; In this I used Ubuntu 14.04.


Instructions: 

Go to:  https://github.com/primetang/qrtools

Using pip will make this process much easier.

Make sure you install all the dependencies listed, and the ZBar Bar Code Reader (I just downloaded the source tarball)

After you have installed qrtools, just run the qr_reader.py file.  You can edit it to run any png or jpg that you have.
